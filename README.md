A very very simple yet FUN iPad Game. This is also my First iOS APP using the Starling FrameWork. 
I am planning on making some minor changes over time but I am focusing on creating more interactive
games using Flare3D.

Stay Tuned and use what ever code you want, I must thank HEMANTH SHARMA for taking the time to create such
a helpful series of videos on the Starling Framework. Please check out his free videos here .....
